# How to Pray in Islam?

Prayer (Salah) is one of the five pillars of Islam and is performed five times daily. In this guide, you will learn the basic steps of prayer for new Muslims.

## The Importance of Prayer

Prayer is the most important act of worship that strengthens the Muslim's connection with Allah. The Quran states about prayer:

> **"Establish prayer, give zakah, and bow with those who bow."** (Al-Baqarah, 43)

## Preparation Before Prayer

### 1. Performing Ablution (Wudu)

Before starting prayer, ablution must be performed:

1. **Say Bismillah**: "Bismillahirrahmanirrahim"
2. **Wash your hands**: Up to the wrists 3 times
3. **Rinse your mouth**: 3 times
4. **Clean your nose**: 3 times
5. **Wash your face**: From ear to ear, forehead to chin 3 times
6. **Wash your arms**: Up to the elbows 3 times
7. **Wipe your head**: With wet hands once
8. **Wash your feet**: Up to the ankles 3 times

### 2. Clean Place and Clothing

- Pray in a clean place
- Wear clean clothes
- Face the Qibla direction (towards Mecca)

## Prayer Times

The five daily prayers are:

1. **Fajr (Dawn)**: From dawn until sunrise
2. **Dhuhr (Noon)**: From when the sun reaches its zenith until Asr time
3. **Asr (Afternoon)**: From afternoon until sunset
4. **Maghrib (Sunset)**: After sunset
5. **Isha (Night)**: From after Maghrib prayer until dawn

## Steps of Prayer

### 1. Intention (Niyyah)

Make intention in your heart for which prayer you will perform:
- "I intend to pray the Fajr prayer"

### 2. Takbiratul Ihram

Raise your hands to ear level and say:
**"Allahu Akbar"** (Allah is the Greatest)

### 3. Opening Supplication (Subhanaka)

Place your hands on your chest and recite:

**"Subhanaka Allahumma wa bihamdika wa tabaraka ismuka wa ta'ala jadduka wa la ilaha ghayruk"**

*English:* "Glory be to You, O Allah, and praise be to You. Blessed is Your name and exalted is Your majesty. There is no god but You."

### 4. Seeking Refuge and Bismillah

**"A'udhu billahi min ash-shaytanir rajim. Bismillahirrahmanirrahim"**

*English:* "I seek refuge in Allah from Satan the accursed. In the name of Allah, the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful."

### 5. Al-Fatiha (The Opening)

**"Alhamdulillahi rabbil alameen. Ar-rahmanir raheem. Maliki yawmid deen. Iyyaka na'budu wa iyyaka nasta'een. Ihdinassiratal mustaqeem. Siratal ladhina an'amta alayhim ghayril maghdubi alayhim wa lad dalleen."**

*English:* "Praise be to Allah, Lord of all the worlds. The Most Gracious, the Most Merciful. Master of the Day of Judgment. You alone we worship, and You alone we ask for help. Guide us to the straight path. The path of those You have blessed, not of those who have incurred Your wrath, nor of those who have gone astray."

### 6. Additional Chapter

After Al-Fatiha, recite a chapter you know (for example, Al-Ikhlas):

**"Qul huwa Allahu ahad. Allahus samad. Lam yalid wa lam yulad. Wa lam yakun lahu kufuwan ahad."**

*English:* "Say: He is Allah, the One. Allah, the Eternal, Absolute. He begets not, nor is He begotten. And there is none like unto Him."

### 7. Bowing (Ruku)

Say **"Allahu Akbar"** and bow:

**"Subhana rabbiyal adheem"** (3 times)
*English:* "Glory be to my Lord, the Most Great"

### 8. Rising from Bowing

Say **"Sami'allahu liman hamidah"** and stand upright:

**"Rabbana lakal hamd"**
*English:* "Our Lord, praise be to You"

### 9. Prostration (Sujud)

Say **"Allahu Akbar"** and prostrate:

**"Subhana rabbiyal a'la"** (3 times)
*English:* "Glory be to my Lord, the Most High"

### 10. Sitting Between Prostrations

Say **"Allahu Akbar"** and sit, then prostrate again.

### 11. Second Unit (Rak'ah)

Repeat the same steps.

### 12. Tashahhud (Sitting)

In two-unit prayers, in the final sitting:

**"At-tahiyyatu lillahi was-salawatu wat-tayyibat. As-salamu alayka ayyuhan-nabiyyu wa rahmatullahi wa barakatuh. As-salamu alayna wa ala ibadillahis-salihin. Ashhadu an la ilaha illallah wa ashhadu anna Muhammadan abduhu wa rasuluh."**

### 13. Salawat (Blessings on the Prophet)

**"Allahumma salli ala Muhammad wa ala ali Muhammad kama sallayta ala Ibrahim wa ala ali Ibrahim innaka hamidun majid. Allahumma barik ala Muhammad wa ala ali Muhammad kama barakta ala Ibrahim wa ala ali Ibrahim innaka hamidun majid."**

### 14. Salutation (Salam)

Turn to the right and left saying:
**"As-salamu alaykum wa rahmatullah"**
*English:* "Peace be upon you and the mercy of Allah"
